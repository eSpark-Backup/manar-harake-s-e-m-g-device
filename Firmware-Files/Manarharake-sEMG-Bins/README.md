# ManarHarake-sEMGDevice Firmware flashing Guide

## 1 ATMEL SAM4s
### 1.1 Setting up the Hardware
The hardware mainly the control board expected to power up over 8.4V (Two cell LiPo / Li-Ion battery). However, due to slight issues with the battery supervisor circuit, the Voltage Divider network expected to bring voltages to safe range had to be removed. **The board is now powered up over 4V for safe operations**.

####  1.1.1 Tools required
1. Power Supply (5V / 1A)
2. JLink Debugger / Programmer
3. USB to USB Type C cable (For serial debugging)


####  1.1.2 Software required
1. [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio#Downloads)

#### 1.1.3 Step by Step configuration
1. Power up the supply and set it to 4V.
2. Connect the power supply cables to the power input pins on the PCB as can be seen in the screenshot below. Make sure the polarity is correct after observing the -ve and +ve pin identifiers
